   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a MySQL database and configure your `.env` file with the credentials.

5. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend:
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd college_management_frontend
   ```

2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```

## 📈 Output

Once the app is running, you'll see a **dashboard** with various sections, such as:

- **Student Records**: A table displaying the list of students with CRUD operations.
- **Courses**: Admin can add or manage courses.
- **Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses.
- **Results**: View exam results for students.

## 🔧 Usage
- Navigate to the React app's dashboard for admin functionalities.
- Students can log in and view their courses, enroll, and check their exam results.
- Admins can manage students, faculty, courses, departments, and exams.

## 🔐 Security
- The app uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and authorization.  
- Sensitive data like database credentials is stored securely in the **.env** file.

## 🔍 Limitations
⚠ This is a basic version of the College Management System.  
⚠ For a more scalable system, further optimizations and features can be added.  

## 🛠 Future Improvements
🔹 Add **notifications** for course updates, exam schedules, etc.  
🔹 Implement **advanced analytics** and reporting for faculty and admin users.  
🔹 Create a **mobile app** version of the system for easier access.  
🔹 Improve **UI/UX** design for better user experience.  
🔹 Implement **auto-scaling** for handling larger amounts of data and traffic.
